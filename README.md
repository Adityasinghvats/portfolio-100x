# Hi, Visitor 

- I am Aditya Kumar and I have build this npm package as a portfolio to showcase my `Node.js` skills.
- You need to have `Node.js` installed on your system to execute it.
- To install the package go to your directory and use command `npm i adix`.
- In you terminal type `npx adix` and voila , you can meet me virtually and take a look at my work.
